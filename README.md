# Product-Review-Classifier

The processing of human-specific characteristics like expression, emotion, speech have been a field of innovation for making the machine intelligence closely resemble the human brain. One such example is the classification of feedback received in the form of text. 
For this purpose, a classifier would be implemented, which shall primarily be able to sort the reviews (once trained) into positive and negative once (and possibly include the intensity of negativity/positivity in the analysis. This shall further enable businesses to focus or address issues that are more pressing/alarming).
